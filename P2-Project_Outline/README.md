# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an application for kids 12+ to gain some knowledge and control over their daily nutrition. As well as contribute to the household responsibilities. Kids can access nutrition info specific to their age and select options from each of the food groups. The selections will be saved to their profile to generate a grocery list for parents and/or search recipes in a database. Inspired by my own picky eater and current "to-do list".
### Features
User Sign up: Parents can sign up with email and create a profile for each child. Users 12+ will be able to create a new profile for themselves, using their parent's email, to view daily nutrition facts based on age. /n

User Login: users will be able to access dashboard with additional features.

Nutrition chart: table charting daily nutrition facts with examples/suggestions for each food group.

Select/Add: Favorite foods from each category/food group, to be saved on dashboard.

Recipes: find simple recipes using favorites list.

Email List:  generate grocery list from favorites and email to parents.

### Technologies
JavaScript
C#/.Net
Razor

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn API for nutrition info, and recipes. I believe I also need to learn more about technologies in general, to determine which are best or necessary to build different programs.
