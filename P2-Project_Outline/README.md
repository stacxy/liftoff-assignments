## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an application for kids 12+ to gain some knowledge and control over their daily nutrition. As well as contribute to the household responsibilities. Kids can access nutrition info specific to their needs and select options from various categories. The selections will be saved to their profile to generate a grocery list for parents and/or search recipes in a database. Inspired by my own picky eater and current "to-do list".
### Features
User Sign up: Parents can sign up with email and create a profile for each child. Users 12+ will be able to create a new profile for themselves, using their parent's email, to view daily nutrition facts based on age. /n

User Login: users will be able to access dashboard with additional features.

Nutrition chart: table charting daily nutrition facts with examples/suggestions for each food group.

Select/Add: Favorite foods from each category/food group, to be saved on dashboard.

Email List:  generate grocery list from favorites and email to parents.

Maybe later: Recipes: find simple recipes using favorites list.

### Technologies
JavaScript
C#/.Net

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn more about APIs, merging separate database . I also need to learn more about technologies in general, to determine which are best or necessary to build different programs. Project planning and organizational tools. Excel, because I have literally never used it. When viable, I need to learn more about authentication, aspnet user roles/claims/tokens in order for parents to have some control since it's built for kids.
